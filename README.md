# Equal Weight S&P 500 Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the S&P 500 index using an equal weight approach. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter notebook and aims to provide insights into the performance and characteristics of an equal-weighted S&P 500 portfolio.

## Files in the Repository

- `001_equal_weight_S&P_500.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis, code, and visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you'll need the following software and Python libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- yfinance (Yahoo Finance API)

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib yfinance
```

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/equal-weight-sp500.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd equal-weight-sp500
    ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Open the `001_equal_weight_S&P_500.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially.

## Project Structure

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: An overview of the project and objectives.
2. **Data Collection**: Fetching historical data for S&P 500 constituents using the Yahoo Finance API.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing the data for analysis.
4. **Equal Weight Portfolio Construction**: Creating an equal-weighted portfolio and calculating its performance.
5. **Analysis and Visualization**: Analyzing the performance metrics and visualizing the results.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and insights from the analysis.

## Results

The results of the analysis include performance metrics such as cumulative returns, volatility, and risk-adjusted returns for the equal-weighted S&P 500 portfolio. Visualizations are provided to help interpret the findings.
