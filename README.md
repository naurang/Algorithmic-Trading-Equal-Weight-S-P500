# algorithmic-trading-equal_weight_S-P_500
Algorithmic trading means using computers to make investment decisions. Computer algorithms can make trades at a speed and frequency that is not possible by a human.
This project basically gets randomly generated S&P 500 data like stock price, and market cap and then calculate the number of share of each company that you have to buy according to create your own S&P 500 portfolio based on portfolio size/investment capital.
For this project have I have used a Free API and keys  https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/ that are used for real-time stock data. If you want to use it for real-life trading then you have to get your own API provider that can get you real-time data for the S&P or any other market indexes.
